## What Makes this a Game?
There is a main goal of bringing your pumpkin cat "home" as the sky darkens each level while escaping evil halloween enemies. You can study the map to understand the quickest or safest routes home, and there are collectibles that you are motivated to find before you can unlock doors. There is also a scoring system based on how much of the map that you explore, shown as collectible treats on screen.
